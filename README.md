## Overview
### Description

### App Evaluation
- **Category:**  Utility/Shopping
- **Mobile:**  This app is suitable to be more than a mobile aplication, but since everyone is using their phones all the time is more comfortable to buy/sell from them.
- **Story:**  Users can create post with the description and picture of the item they want to buy, also to create their own post to sell and communicate with other users via chat in the app
- **Market:**  Almost every person who wants to buy something
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often as the person wants. They can open the app when they're looking for something specfically or looking for good deals. The app will also make uploading new items to sell extremely easy.
- **Scope:** Any type of item will be able to be sold
